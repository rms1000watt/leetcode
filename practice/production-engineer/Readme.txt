1.Write a script that connects to 100 hosts, looks for a particular process and sends an email with a report.
2.Read data from an API call that gives structured data in JSON format and arrange that data in the requested format.
3.Reading from STDIN and receiving two parameters which was host and ports that I need to reach and print status,what if this input is the file with 1tb(here interaction with large inputs & optimization)
4.read innate file and parse the strings to count how many times an email address is found
5.You will be supplied with two data files in CSV format .
The first file contains statistics about various dinosaurs. The second file contains additional data.
Given the following formula, speed = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT(LEG_LENGTH * g)
Where g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)
Write a program to read in the data files from disk, it must then print the names of only the bipedal dinosaurs from fastest to slowest.
6. check if string is palindrome
